**DocMind AI** is a powerful, open-source Streamlit application that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) running locally on your machine through [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Analyze a vast array of document types, extract key insights, generate summaries, identify action items, and surface open questions – all without sending your data to the cloud!

## 🚀 Getting Started with DocMind AI: Local LLM Analysis

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- (Optional) Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment.

### ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BjornMelin/docmind-ai.git
   cd docmind-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### ▶️ Running the App

**Locally:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**With Docker:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 💻 Usage

### 🎛️ Selecting a Model

1. Enter the **Ollama Base URL** (default: `http://localhost:11434`).
2. Choose your desired **Ollama Model Name** (e.g., `llama2`) from the dropdown.

### 📁 Uploading Documents

Click the **"Browse files"** button to upload one or more documents. Supported file types are listed above in the [Features](#-features) section.

### ✍️ Choosing Prompts

Select a pre-defined prompt from the dropdown:

- **Comprehensive Document Analysis:** Get a summary, key insights, action items, and open questions.
- **Extract Key Insights and Action Items:** Focus on extracting these two elements.
- **Summarize and Identify Open Questions:** Generate a summary and a list of open questions.
- **Custom Prompt:** Enter your own prompt to guide the analysis.

### 😃 Selecting Tone

Choose the desired tone for the LLM's response:

- **Professional:** Objective and formal.
- **Academic:** Scholarly and research-oriented.
- **Informal:** Casual and conversational.
- **Creative:** Imaginative and artistic.
- **Neutral:** Unbiased and objective.
- **Direct:** Concise and to-the-point.
- **Empathetic:** Understanding and compassionate.
- **Humorous:** Witty and lighthearted.
- **Authoritative:** Confident and expert.
- **Inquisitive:** Curious and exploratory.

### 🧮 Selecting Instructions

Select the persona or instructions that the LLM should follow:

- **General Assistant:** Act as a helpful assistant.
- **Researcher:** Provide in-depth research and analysis.
- **Software Engineer:** Focus on technical details and code.
- **Product Manager:** Consider product strategy and user experience.
- **Data Scientist:** Emphasize data analysis and modeling.
- **Business Analyst:** Analyze from a business and strategic perspective.
- **Technical Writer:** Create clear and concise documentation.
