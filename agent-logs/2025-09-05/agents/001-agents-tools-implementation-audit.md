Owner: Agents/Platform
Branch: current working branch
Scope: Comprehensive verification against three planning reports

Sources reviewed

Outcome summary
- Tools refactor complete; public API preserved via aggregator with explicit exports.
- Router tool JSON contract implemented; error-resilient, never raises.
- Retrieval tool hardened; DSPy optional; GraphRAG and multimodal paths in place.
- Coordinator wires router_tool; supervisor compile uses checkpointer; InjectedState overrides.

## A) 003‑agent‑final‑researched‑plan — Checklist

1) Supervisor orchestration (LangGraph)
- [x] create_supervisor with InMemorySaver, forward message tool, output_mode="structured".
  - Evidence: src/agents/coordinator.py (_setup_agent_graph, compile(checkpointer=self.memory)).
- [x] InjectedState/tools_data overrides (router_engine and toggles) honored.
  - Evidence: coordinator.process_query defaults + settings_override merge.
- [x] Parallel tool calls enabled, pre/post hooks for context trimming/metrics.
  - Evidence: coordinator constants and hooks.

2) RouterQueryEngine + strategy tools
- [x] Strategy names canonical: semantic_search, hybrid_search, sub_question_search, knowledge_graph, multimodal_search.
  - Evidence: src/retrieval/query_engine.py tool names; tests reference sub_question_search.
- [x] SubQuestionQueryEngine adoption; no multi_query_search remnants.
  - Evidence: repo search; tests updated (unit/integration).

3) Router tool JSON contract
- [x] Input via InjectedState; engine read from state/tools_data.
- [x] Success keys: response_text, selected_strategy, multimodal_used, hybrid_used, timing_ms.
- [x] Error path returns {error} and never raises.
  - Evidence: src/agents/tools/router_tool.py; unit tests.

4) Reranking (ADR‑037)
- [x] Multimodal reranker wiring validated via integration tests.
  - Evidence: tests/integration/test_modality_aware_reranking.py (visual modality path); text reranker present elsewhere.

5) GraphRAG default‑on (ADR‑019 addendum)
- [x] settings.enable_graphrag = True by default.
  - Evidence: src/config/settings.py (Field(default=True)).
- [x] knowledge_graph tool registration when KG index present; rollback disables.
  - Evidence: create_adaptive_router_engine; tests/integration/test_graphrag_default_on.py.

6) Multimodal ingestion & indexing
- [x] PDF page‑image nodes emission; conditional MultiModalVectorStoreIndex.
  - Evidence: src/app.py (pdf_pages_to_image_documents, multimodal index if images exist).

7) Modes/UX parity (Quick vs Agentic)
- [x] Controls for reranker mode / normalize / top‑n exist and feed settings.
  - Evidence: build_reranker_controls(SETTINGS) in src/app.py; coordinator honors toggles.
- [~] Explicit parity test across modes.
  - Observation: No dedicated "reranker parity" test file; existing integration tests cover reranker behavior indirectly.

8) DSPy optional rewrite (fail‑closed)
- [x] Retrieval tool uses DSPy when available; fallback to refined/variants for short queries on ImportError.
  - Evidence: src/agents/tools/retrieval.py (_optimize_queries) with ImportError branch and short‑query variants.

9) Telemetry & metrics
- [x] Router timing; selected strategy booleans logged; coordinator metrics maintained.
  - Evidence: router_tool timing_ms; coordinator optimization_metrics in post‑hook.

Acceptance Criteria overall: Met (with parity test noted below).


## B) agents‑tools‑refactor‑plan — Checklist

1) Module split
- [x] router_tool.py, planning.py, retrieval.py, synthesis.py, validation.py, telemetry.py present; aggregator re‑exports via __init__.py.
  - Evidence: src/agents/tools/* and explicit __all__ in aggregator.

2) Public API stability
- [x] from src.agents.tools import ... works; tests patch aggregator‑level points (ToolFactory, logger, ChatMemoryBuffer, time).
  - Evidence: aggregator binds these; tests updated accordingly.

3) Re‑enable complexity rules (pylint)
- [x] too‑many‑branches/‑statements/‑nested‑blocks not globally disabled; design limits present.
  - Evidence: .pylintrc has max‑* limits, no global disable for those rules.

4) Lint fixes post‑split
- [x] Extracted helpers and guard clauses used; ruff clean; pylint tests ≥ 9.8.
  - Evidence: earlier pylint runs; no outstanding ruff issues.

5) CI/test gates & CHANGELOG
- [x] Tests green; runner cleaned (ASCII output) and import validation list fixed.
  - Evidence: scripts/run_tests.py updated; tiered run OK.
- [~] CHANGELOG updated with refactor summary.
  - Observation: CHANGELOG.md not edited in this branch; can add a concise entry before PR.

Acceptance Criteria overall: Met (with CHANGELOG note).


## C) 001‑agents‑tools‑tests‑migration‑plan — Checklist

Target structure coverage
- [x] router_tool: tests/unit/agents/test_router_tool.py (present; passes).
- [x] planning.plan_query: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_planning_plan_query.py (present & updated; passes).
- [x] planning.route_query: covered in integration/async comms tests; heuristics validated.
- [x] retrieval.retrieve_documents: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_retrieval.py covers fast‑path (conditional), DSPy, fallback, hybrid/vector, dedup, parsing.
- [x] synthesis.synthesize_results: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_synthesis.py present & covering JSON/error/limits.
- [x] validation.validate_response: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_validation_tool.py covers checks + error handling.
- [x] telemetry.log_event: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_telemetry.py present; non‑failing.
- [x] aggregator surface: tests/unit/agents/tools/test_aggregator_surface.py present; verifies re‑exports & patch points.
- [x] integration aggregator: tests/integration/agents/tools/test_aggregator_integration.py present.

Deletions/moves
- [x] Legacy monolithic tests retired/absorbed; module‑focused suites in place.
  - Evidence: new module tests exist; no reliance on deprecated multi_query_search.

Mocking guidance adherence
- [x] Tests patch through src.agents.tools.* (ToolFactory, logger, ChatMemoryBuffer, time).

Quality
- [x] Ruff + Pylint green; tests deterministic and isolated.

Acceptance Criteria overall: Met.


## D) Additional Coverage Improvements (This Branch)

- Added utils coverage suites:
  - tests/unit/utils/test_document_utils_unit.py (document metadata/cache/spaCy KG helpers)
  - tests/unit/utils/test_core_additional.py (async contexts, async_timer error path)
  - tests/unit/utils/test_monitoring_additional.py (performance timers failure paths)
- All tests pass; raised coverage in under‑covered modules without adding flakiness.


## E) Open Items / Follow‑Ups Before PR

High priority
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG entry summarizing tools refactor, test migration, and runner updates per the refactor plan.
- [ ] Optional: add a parity integration test to explicitly assert reranker toggles (mode/normalize/top_n) behave identically in Quick vs Agentic paths (plan §3.5). Existing tests cover reranker behavior, but a focused parity test would align with the plan’s explicit item.

Medium
- [ ] Consider a small contract test for router_tool JSON fields when metadata is absent (explicitly document selected_strategy omission behavior in tests/docs).
- [ ] Review telemetry granularity for GraphRAG and reranking counts if we want per‑stage metrics matching plan §6 (log keys exist; ensure structured aggregation if needed).

Low
- [ ] Confirm CI config invokes updated `scripts/run_tests.py` (ASCII output safe) and includes unit+integration tiers; ensure pylint gate ≥ 9.5 runs on tests in CI (it passes locally).


## F) File & Commit References

Core updated modules
- src/agents/tools/{router_tool.py, planning.py, retrieval.py, synthesis.py, validation.py, constants.py, __init__.py}
- src/agents/coordinator.py (supervisor compile, InjectedState defaults, router_tool wiring)
- src/app.py (GraphRAG default‑on, multimodal ingestion/index, router engine creation)

Tests (selection)
- tests/unit/agents/tools/test_{router_tool,planning_plan_query,retrieval,synthesis,validation_tool,telemetry,aggregator_surface}.py
- tests/integration/test_{graphrag_default_on,modality_aware_reranking,query_engine}.py
- tests/integration/agents/tools/test_aggregator_integration.py
- Added: tests/unit/utils/test_{document_utils_unit,core_additional,monitoring_additional}.py

Runner
- scripts/run_tests.py (ASCII logs; fixed import validation list; tiered strategy kept)

Commits
- refactor(tools): use aggregator references and harden JSON/strategy paths
- test(agents,integration): stabilize supervisor shims and resilience paths
- test(utils): raise coverage and harden failure-path assertions
- chore(scripts): make test runner ASCII-safe and fix import validation list

---

## G) Decision: Ready for PR?

Yes, with the two follow‑ups before merging:
- Add CHANGELOG entry for the refactor + test migration.
- (Optional but recommended) Add a focused reranker parity integration test to mirror plan §3.5 explicitly.

All other requirements from the three reports are implemented and validated with green gates.
