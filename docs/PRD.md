# DocMind AI - Product Requirements Document

> **Architecture Update (2025-08-18):** This PRD has been updated to reflect the final 5-agent LangGraph supervisor system as defined in ADR-011-NEW, replacing previous single-agent approaches with enhanced multi-agent coordination for improved quality and reliability.

## 1. Executive Summary

DocMind AI is an offline-first document analysis system architected for high performance, privacy, and maintainability. It leverages a pure **LlamaIndex** stack to combine hybrid vector search, knowledge graphs, and a **5-agent LangGraph supervisor system** for intelligent document processing with 128K context capability through FP8 KV cache optimization. By eliminating external APIs and prioritizing local computation, it provides a secure, high-throughput environment for users to analyze their documents.

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity

**Problem Statement:** In today's data-rich world, professionals, researchers, and students are inundated with digital documents. Extracting meaningful insights is a time-consuming, manual process. Furthermore, existing AI-powered solutions are almost exclusively cloud-based, forcing users to upload sensitive or proprietary documents to third-party servers, creating significant privacy risks and vendor lock-in. There is limited availability of solutions that offer modern AI capabilities with complete privacy through local, offline processing.

**Opportunity:** There is growing market demand for professional tools that deliver advanced AI capabilities without compromising on data security. By building a high-performance, offline-first RAG application with 128K context capability, DocMind AI can serve this underserved segment. The solution provides fast, intelligent, and completely private document processing, making it an effective choice for security-conscious users.
