# DocMind AI - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

DocMind AI is an offline-first document analysis system architected for exceptional performance, privacy, and maintainability. It leverages a pure **LlamaIndex** stack to combine hybrid vector search, knowledge graphs, and a powerful **single ReAct agent** for intelligent document processing. By eliminating external APIs and prioritizing local computation, it provides a secure, high-throughput environment for users to analyze their documents.

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity

**Problem Statement:** In today's data-rich world, professionals, researchers, and students are inundated with digital documents. Extracting meaningful insights is a time-consuming, manual process. Furthermore, existing AI-powered solutions are almost exclusively cloud-based, forcing users to upload sensitive or proprietary documents to third-party servers, creating significant privacy risks and vendor lock-in. There is no solution on the market that offers elite, modern AI capabilities with the absolute privacy of local, offline processing.

**Opportunity:** There is a clear and growing market demand for a "prosumer" and professional tool that delivers the power of advanced AI without compromising on data security. By building a high-performance, offline-first RAG application, DocMind AI can capture this underserved segment. We will provide a "no-compromise" solution that is fast, intelligent, and completely private, positioning ourselves as the leading choice for security-conscious users.

* **FR-6: Multimodal Embeddings**: The system must generate distinct embeddings for images (e.g., using CLIP ViT-B/32) to enable multimodal search capabilities. **(ADR-016)**
* **FR-7: High-Relevance Reranking**: The system must include a post-retrieval reranking step to refine the order of retrieved documents and improve the final context quality. **(ADR-014)**
* **FR-8: Single Agent Interface**: All user queries and interactions must be handled by a single, powerful ReAct Agent capable of reasoning, planning, and dynamic tool selection. **(ADR-011)**
* **FR-9: Multi-Backend LLM Support**: The system must be capable of using multiple local LLM backends (Ollama, LlamaCPP, vLLM) interchangeably. **(ADR-019)**
* **FR-10: Session Persistence**: The system must persist chat history and agent state across sessions to provide a continuous user experience. **(ADR-008)**
* **FR-11: Data Caching**: The system must cache the results of expensive processing steps (like document parsing and chunking) to avoid re-computation for unchanged files. **(ADR-008, ADR-006)**
* **FR-12: Configurable UI**: The user interface must provide controls for users to toggle key settings, such as GPU acceleration or LLM backend selection. **(ADR-009)**

### Non-Functional Requirements (How the System Performs)

* **NFR-1: Performance - High Throughput**: The system must be optimized to achieve ~1000 tokens/second for LLM inference on supported hardware (e.g., RTX 4090). **(ADR-003, ADR-017)**
* **NFR-2: Performance - Fast Reranking**: The primary reranking model must be lightweight (`BGE-reranker-v2-m3`) to ensure minimal latency impact on the query pipeline. **(ADR-014)**
* **NFR-3: Performance - Asynchronous Processing**: The system must leverage asynchronous and parallel processing patterns (`QueryPipeline.parallel_run`) for all I/O-bound and compute-intensive tasks to ensure a non-blocking UI and maximum throughput. **(ADR-012)**
* **NFR-4: Privacy - Offline First**: The system must be capable of operating 100% offline, with no reliance on external APIs for any core functionality, including parsing and model inference. **(ADR-001)**
* **NFR-5: Resilience - Robust Error Handling**: The system must be resilient to transient failures (e.g., network hiccups, file errors) by implementing intelligent retry strategies (e.g., exponential backoff) for all critical infrastructure operations. **(ADR-022)**
* **NFR-6: Memory Efficiency - VRAM Optimization**: The system must employ model quantization (TorchAO int4) to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs by ~58%, allowing larger models to run on consumer hardware. **(ADR-023)**
* **NFR-7: Memory Efficiency - Multimodal VRAM**: The multimodal embedding model (CLIP ViT-B/32) must be selected for its low VRAM usage (~1.4GB) to ensure efficiency. **(ADR-016)**

* **AR-2: Library-First Principle**: Development must prioritize the use of proven, well-maintained libraries over custom-built solutions for common problems (e.g., using Tenacity for retries, not custom code). **(ADR-018)**
* **AR-3: Unified Configuration**: All global configurations (LLM, embedding model, chunk size, etc.) must be managed through the native LlamaIndex `Settings` singleton, eliminating dual-configuration systems. **(ADR-020)**
* **AR-4: Simplified GPU Management**: GPU device allocation and management must be handled via the native `device_map="auto"` pattern, eliminating the need for complex custom monitoring scripts. **(ADR-003)**
* **AR-5: Native Component Integration**: The system must use native LlamaIndex components for core tasks, such as `UnstructuredReader` for parsing, `IngestionPipeline` for processing, and `IngestionCache` for caching. **(ADR-004, ADR-006)**
* **AR-6: Standardized Model**: The default reasoning LLM shall be `Qwen3-4B-Thinking` due to its superior agentic capabilities and performance with quantization. **(ADR-017)**

## 5. Out of Scope (for v1.0)

To ensure a focused and timely initial release, the following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for version 1.0:

* **Real-time Collaboration:** The system is designed for a single user. Features like multi-user editing, commenting, or real-time sync are not included.

* **Mobile Applications:** There will be no native iOS or Android applications for v1.0.
* **Automated Document Ingestion:** The system will not automatically monitor folders or other sources for new documents. Users must manually add files.
* **Advanced User and Access Management:** There will be no concept of multiple user accounts, roles, or permissions within the application.
* **Non-English Language Support:** All models and optimizations are focused on English-language documents for the initial release.

## 6. System Architecture
