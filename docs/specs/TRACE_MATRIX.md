## Critical Path Analysis

### Blocking Requirements

These requirements must be implemented first as others depend on them:

1. **REQ-0061** (100% offline) - Blocks all functionality
2. **REQ-0063-v2** (FP8 LLM model) - Blocks agent system
3. **REQ-0047** (Qdrant) - Blocks retrieval
4. **REQ-0071** (Streamlit) - Blocks all UI features
5. **REQ-0081** (Config) - Blocks settings management

### High-Risk Requirements

Requirements with significant technical complexity or performance implications:

1. **REQ-0001** - Multi-agent coordination complexity
2. **REQ-0007** - Agent latency constraint
3. **REQ-0026** - Document processing throughput
4. **REQ-0046** - Query latency constraint
5. **REQ-0064-v2** - FP8 quantization performance with 128K context (requires vLLM backend)
6. **REQ-0094-v2** - 128K context memory management (FP8 KV cache optimization required)

### vLLM Backend Requirements

The following requirements mandate vLLM backend with FlashInfer for optimal performance:

- **REQ-0063-v2**: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-FP8 model loading
- **REQ-0064-v2**: FP8 quantization + FP8 KV cache optimization
- **REQ-0094-v2**: 128K context window management
- **Risk Level**: High - FP8 kernel compatibility varies across hardware
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to AWQ quantization if FP8 kernels unavailable
