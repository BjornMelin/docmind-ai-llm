## 1. Objective

The User Interface System provides an intuitive Streamlit-based web interface for document analysis, enabling users to upload documents, interact with the multi-agent system through natural language queries, configure system settings, view retrieved sources with attribution, maintain conversation history, and export analysis results - all while operating entirely offline with real-time status updates.

- Export functionality (Markdown, JSON)
- Real-time processing status
- Error handling and user feedback

### Out of Scope

- Mobile native applications
- Desktop native applications
- Multi-user collaboration
- Real-time synchronization
- Custom UI themes beyond Streamlit defaults

## 3. Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

## 4. Interfaces

### Main Application Interface

```python
class StreamlitApp:
    """Main Streamlit application controller."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize app with session state."""
        self.init_session_state()
        self.load_configuration()
    
    def render_sidebar(self) -> None:
        """Render sidebar with settings and upload."""
        pass
    
    def render_chat_interface(self) -> None:
        """Render main chat interface."""
        pass
    
    def render_source_viewer(self) -> None:
        """Render source documents panel."""
        pass
```

### Session State Manager

```python
class SessionStateManager:
    """Manages Streamlit session state."""
    
    def initialize_state(self) -> None:
        """Initialize session variables."""
        st.session_state.messages = []
        st.session_state.documents = []
        st.session_state.settings = {}
        st.session_state.processing = False
    
    def add_message(
        self,
        role: str,
        content: str,
        sources: Optional[List[Document]] = None
    ) -> None:
        """Add message to chat history."""
        pass
    
    def persist_session(self) -> None:
        """Save session to database."""
        pass
```

### Upload Handler

```python
class DocumentUploadHandler:
    """Handles document upload and processing."""
    
    async def process_upload(
        self,
        uploaded_file: UploadedFile
    ) -> ProcessingResult:
        """Process uploaded document."""
        pass
    
    def validate_file(
        self,
        file: UploadedFile
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """Validate file type and size."""
        pass
```

```

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Document Upload Flow

```gherkin
Given a user on the main interface
When they drag and drop a PDF document
Then the upload progress is displayed
And the document is processed asynchronously
And a success notification appears
And the document appears in the sidebar
And the UI remains responsive during processing
```

### Scenario 2: Chat Interaction

```gherkin
Given a user with uploaded documents
When they type a query and press Enter
Then the query appears in the chat history
And a typing indicator shows while processing
And the response streams in real-time
And source documents are displayed below the response
And the response includes clickable source citations
```

### Scenario 3: Settings Configuration

```gherkin
Given a user in the settings panel
When they toggle GPU acceleration off
Then the setting persists across sessions
And the system switches to CPU mode
And a confirmation message appears
And performance metrics update accordingly
```

### Scenario 4: Session Persistence

```gherkin
Given a user with an active chat session
When they refresh the browser page
Then the chat history is restored
And uploaded documents remain available
And settings are preserved
And the conversation can continue seamlessly
```

### Scenario 5: Export Functionality

```gherkin
Given a user with chat history and documents
When they click "Export to Markdown"
Then a formatted markdown file is generated
And it includes all messages with timestamps
And source citations are properly formatted
And the file downloads automatically
And includes session metadata
```

### Scenario 6: Comprehensive Error Handling

```gherkin
Given a user uploads an invalid file or experiences system errors
When document processing fails
Or when the 5-agent system encounters coordination issues
Or when memory management hits 128K context limits
Then st.status containers show error state with details
And user-friendly error messages appear with recovery suggestions
And technical details are available in expandable sections
And the system gracefully degrades to basic RAG if agents fail
And errors are logged with full context for debugging
And the UI remains responsive and functional
And retry mechanisms are available for recoverable errors
```

### Scenario 7: Analysis Mode Selection (ADR-023)

```gherkin
Given a user with multiple uploaded documents
When they select "Analyze each document separately" mode
And they submit a query about comparing documents
Then the DocumentAnalysisModeManager activates parallel processing
And individual analysis results are generated using the 5-agent system
And cross-document patterns are identified through ResultAggregator
And comparative analysis is provided with processing metrics
And UI displays results in tabs for each document
And synthesized insights show patterns across all documents
And performance monitoring tracks 3-5x speedup achievements
```

### Scenario 8: Dynamic Prompt Template Configuration (ADR-020)

```gherkin
Given a user wants to customize their analysis approach
When they access the prompt configuration panel
And they select role: "researcher", tone: "academic", detail: "comprehensive"
And they choose prompt type: "comprehensive_analysis"
Then the PromptTemplateManager compiles the template from 1,600+ combinations
And DSPy optimization enhances the prompt effectiveness
And the template is cached for future use
And the chat interface adapts to the selected configuration
And responses reflect the academic researcher perspective
And the export system uses matching academic templates
```
