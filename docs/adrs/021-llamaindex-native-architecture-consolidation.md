# ADR-021: LlamaIndex Native Architecture Consolidation

## Title

LlamaIndex Native Architecture Consolidation with Strategic External Libraries

## Version/Date

3.0 / August 13, 2025

## Status

Accepted

## Description

Consolidates to pure LlamaIndex native architecture achieving 60-65% dependency reduction with strategic external libraries (Tenacity, Streamlit) and GPU optimization integration.

## Context

Following comprehensive architectural research and integration with ADR-020's Settings migration, ADR-003's GPU optimization, and ADR-023's PyTorch optimization strategies, significant opportunities have been identified for substantial simplification through LlamaIndex native architecture consolidation with performance enhancement. Current DocMind AI implementation relies on 40 external packages with complex abstraction layers that violate KISS > DRY > YAGNI principles.

**Strategic Consolidation with Performance Integration:**

- Current: 40 external packages with complex integration requirements + custom GPU management

- Target: 15-20 core packages (60-65% dependency reduction) + GPU optimization integration

- Approach: Strategic external library adoption (Tenacity, Streamlit) for production gaps + Settings.llm with Qwen3-4B-Thinking

- Performance Enhancement: device_map="auto" + TorchAO quantization for ~1000 tokens/sec capability

## Related Requirements

- **KISS > DRY > YAGNI Compliance**: Maximum architectural simplification

- **Library-First Priority**: Leverage LlamaIndex native ecosystem  

- **Multi-Backend Flexibility**: Unified Settings.llm support for Ollama, LlamaCPP, vLLM with GPU optimization

- **Performance Targets**: ~1000 tokens/sec capability with TorchAO quantization (1.89x speedup, 58% memory reduction)

- **GPU Optimization Integration**: device_map="auto" eliminates 90% of custom GPU management code

- **Async Pattern Integration**: QueryPipeline.parallel_run() for maximum throughput

- **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive resilience and performance optimization with Qwen3-4B-Thinking

- **Strategic External Enhancement**: Selective adoption where LlamaIndex gaps exist

## Decision

**Adopt Comprehensive LlamaIndex Native Architecture with GPU Optimization and Performance Enhancement** consolidating the DocMind AI system into a unified ecosystem approach with multi-backend support, Settings.llm configuration, and integrated performance optimization.

**Core Decision Framework:**

1. **Native-First**: Replace external dependencies with LlamaIndex native components + Settings.llm with Qwen3-4B-Thinking
2. **Multi-Backend Strategy**: Unified `Settings.llm` configuration for Ollama, LlamaCPP, vLLM with GPU optimization  
3. **Performance Integration**: device_map="auto" + TorchAO quantization for ~1000 tokens/sec capability
4. **Async Pattern Integration**: QueryPipeline.parallel_run() for maximum throughput with native components
5. **Strategic External**: Maintain Tenacity (resilience) and Streamlit (UI) where gaps exist
6. **Substantial Simplification**: 60-65% dependency reduction + 90% GPU management code reduction

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-019** (Multi-Backend LLM): Native backend implementation via Settings.llm

- **ADR-020** (Settings Migration): Unified native Settings adoption

- **ADR-015** (LlamaIndex Migration): Completion of pure ecosystem adoption

- **ADR-018** (Refactoring Decisions): Library-first simplification success

- **ADR-003** (GPU Optimization): Multi-backend RTX 4090 optimization + device_map="auto" simplification

- **ADR-012** (Async Performance Optimization): QueryPipeline.parallel_run() async patterns integration

- **ADR-017** (Default Model Strategy): Qwen3-4B-Thinking multi-backend model configurations

- **ADR-023** (PyTorch Optimization Strategy): TorchAO quantization and mixed precision integration

## Design

### Strategic External Library Decision Framework

**LlamaIndex Gap Analysis with Performance Integration:**

- **Resilience**: LlamaIndex native retry limited → Tenacity comprehensive coverage + async patterns

- **UI Framework**: No native LlamaIndex UI → Streamlit optimization maintained

- **GPU Management**: Native device_map="auto" → 90% code complexity reduction vs custom GPU monitoring

- **Performance Optimization**: Native TorchAO integration → 1.89x speedup, 58% memory reduction

- **Core Components**: Extensive native ecosystem + Settings.llm → 60-65% dependency replacement with performance enhancement

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Phase 1: Native foundation with Settings.llm multi-backend support + Qwen3-4B-Thinking configuration

- Phase 2: GPU optimization integration (device_map="auto" + TorchAO quantization)

- Phase 3: Async patterns integration (QueryPipeline.parallel_run() capabilities)

- Phase 4: Strategic external integration (Tenacity, Streamlit) for production gaps

- Phase 5: Performance validation across all backends (~1000 tokens/sec capability)
