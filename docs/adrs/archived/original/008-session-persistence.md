# ADR-008: Session Persistence

## Title

Persistence and Caching for Sessions and Data

## Version/Date

7.0 / August 14, 2025

## Status

Accepted

## Description

Adopts SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode for structured data persistence (KV stores, knowledge graphs) and the native LlamaIndex `IngestionCache` for caching document processing transformations. Session state for the agent is managed by a `ChatMemoryBuffer` with a 65K token limit.

## Context

The system requires a robust, offline-first persistence strategy for multiple data types: chat history, agent state, processed document chunks/embeddings, and knowledge graph data. The solution must support local concurrent operations (e.g., a user interacting with the agent while a large document is indexed in the background) and be deeply integrated with the LlamaIndex framework to minimize custom code.

## Related Requirements

- **Offline/Local Operation**: The entire persistence layer must function without internet access.
- **Unified Caching**: A single, native mechanism should handle caching for the document ingestion pipeline.
- **Concurrent Access**: The system must support local multi-process access, particularly for the structured data store.
- **Simplified Session Management**: The persistence strategy must align with the single ReAct agent architecture.
- **Performance**: The solution must be efficient and not introduce significant latency.

## Alternatives

- **In-Memory Only**: Simple but volatile; state is lost on restart. Rejected for poor user experience.
- **Redis**: Requires a separate server process, adding unnecessary complexity and overhead for a local-first application. Rejected as over-engineering.
- **Custom Caching (`diskcache`)**: Requires custom wrappers and maintenance, violating the library-first principle. Superseded by the native `IngestionCache`.
- **Complex Agent Checkpointers (`SqliteSaver`)**: Designed for multi-agent state coordination (e.g., LangGraph) and is overly complex for a single ReAct agent. Rejected for violating KISS.

## Decision

1. **Structured Data Store**: Use **SQLite** with **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enabled**. This provides a robust, file-based database that supports concurrent read/write operations, making it ideal for storing knowledge graph data and key-value stores via the LlamaIndex `StorageContext`.
2. **Document Processing Cache**: Use the native **`llama_index.core.ingestion.IngestionCache`**. This component is integrated directly into the `IngestionPipeline` and automatically handles the caching of document transformations (parsing, chunking, embedding), providing an 80-95% reduction in re-processing time for unchanged documents with zero custom code.
3. **Agent Session State**: Use the native **`llama_index.core.memory.ChatMemoryBuffer`** with a `token_limit` of 65,536. This provides a large context window for the single ReAct agent, is simpler to manage than external checkpointers, and persists as part of the agent's in-memory state.

## Related Decisions

- `ADR-021` (LlamaIndex Native Architecture Consolidation): This decision aligns with the principle of using native LlamaIndex components.
- `ADR-020` (LlamaIndex Native Settings Migration): The persistence components are configured via the unified `Settings` singleton.
- `ADR-022` (Tenacity Resilience Integration): Resilience patterns should be applied to all SQLite database operations.
- `ADR-011` (LlamaIndex ReAct Agent Architecture): The choice of `ChatMemoryBuffer` is a direct result of simplifying to a single agent.
- `ADR-004` (Document Loading): `IngestionCache` is used in the loading pipeline.
- `ADR-006` (Analysis Pipeline): `IngestionCache` is a core component of the pipeline.
- `ADR-012` (Async Performance Optimization): Async patterns are used for all database and cache interactions to ensure a non-blocking UI.

## Design

### Structured Store and Ingestion Cache Setup

```python
# In utils.py: Setting up the core persistence components
from llama_index.core import StorageContext, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.core.storage.kvstore.simple_kvstore import SimpleKVStore
from llama_index.core.ingestion import IngestionPipeline, IngestionCache
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter

# 1. Setup SQLite for structured data (e.g., KG store) with WAL mode for concurrency
# This context can be passed to indices that require structured storage.
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(
    kvstore=SimpleKVStore.from_sqlite_path(
        "docmind_kv.db",
        wal=True
    )
)

# 2. Setup IngestionCache for the document processing pipeline
# This requires no custom code, just instantiation.
ingestion_cache = IngestionCache()

# The cache is passed directly to the pipeline, which handles all logic.
ingestion_pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
    transformations=[SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=200)],
    cache=ingestion_cache
)
```

### Agent Memory for Session Persistence

```python
# In agent_factory.py: Configuring the agent's memory
from llama_index.core import Settings
from llama_index.core.agent import ReActAgent
from llama_index.core.memory import ChatMemoryBuffer

# 3. The agent's memory buffer holds the conversational context.
# The 65K token limit covers 95% of typical document analysis sessions.
# The LLM is configured globally via the Settings singleton.
memory = ChatMemoryBuffer.from_defaults(token_limit=65536)

agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(
    tools=[...],
    llm=Settings.llm, # Uses the globally configured Qwen3-4B-Thinking model
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Testing the Persistence Layer

```python
# In tests/test_persistence.py
import time
import asyncio

async def test_ingestion_cache_performance():
    """Verify that the IngestionCache significantly reduces re-processing time."""
    # The pipeline is configured with an IngestionCache
    pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
        transformations=[SentenceSplitter()],
        cache=IngestionCache()
    )
    documents = [Document(text="This is a test document.")]

    # First run populates the cache
    start_time_1 = time.monotonic()
    await pipeline.arun(documents=documents)
    end_time_1 = time.monotonic()
    duration_1 = end_time_1 - start_time_1

    # Second run should be much faster due to the cache hit
    start_time_2 = time.monotonic()
    await pipeline.arun(documents=documents)
    end_time_2 = time.monotonic()
    duration_2 = end_time_2 - start_time_2

    # Assert that the cached run is at least 80% faster
    assert duration_2 < duration_1 * 0.2
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Offline & Robust**: Provides a complete, offline persistence layer using reliable, file-based SQLite and native LlamaIndex components.
- **Performant Concurrency**: SQLite's WAL mode allows for non-blocking reads and writes, crucial for a responsive UI during background indexing.
- **Simplified Caching**: `IngestionCache` completely eliminates the need for custom caching logic, reducing maintenance and potential bugs.
- **Maintainable**: The architecture avoids the complexity of distributed systems (like Redis) and over-engineered agent state managers, aligning with the KISS principle.
- **Efficient**: `IngestionCache` provides a significant performance boost by preventing redundant computations on unchanged documents.

### Future Considerations

- If the application's requirements evolve to necessitate a distributed or multi-user architecture, this persistence layer would need to be reassessed. A transition to a client-server database like PostgreSQL or a dedicated cache like Redis would be considered in a new ADR at that time.
