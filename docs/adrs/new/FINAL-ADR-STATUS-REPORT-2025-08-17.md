## Implementation Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Can Start Immediately

- [x] All core ADRs ready (001-004, 006-007, 009-016, 018-019)
- [x] Dependencies validated and compatible
- [x] Models available locally (Qwen3-14B, BGE-M3, BGE-reranker)
- [x] Infrastructure minimal (Qdrant + SQLite only)
- [x] No blocking issues found

### ❌ ADRs to Delete

- [ ] Delete ADR-005 (Framework Abstraction)
- [ ] Delete/Defer ADR-008 (Production Observability)
- [ ] Already deleted ADR-017 (Component Library)

### ⚠️ Minor Considerations

1. **Instructor + Qwen3**: May need tweaking for structured outputs
2. **PropertyGraphIndex**: New, less documented than other approaches
3. **DSPy**: Experimental but isolated as optional module

## Timeline Assessment

### ✅ 3-Week Timeline Remains Realistic

#### **Week 1: Core Infrastructure**

- Document processing pipeline (ADR-009)
- Embedding strategy (ADR-002)
- Persistence layer (ADR-007)
- Basic retrieval (ADR-003)

#### **Week 2: Intelligence Layer**

- Agent orchestration (ADR-011)
- Agentic RAG patterns (ADR-001)
- Reranking (ADR-006)
- Performance optimization (ADR-010)

#### **Week 3: UI & Polish**

- Streamlit UI (ADR-013, ADR-016)
- Testing (ADR-014)
- Optional modules (ADR-018, ADR-019)
- Deployment (ADR-015)

## Key Recommendations

### 1. Start with Minimal Core

Begin with basic RAG pipeline, add agent/graph features incrementally.

### 2. PropertyGraphIndex Advantages

The updated ADR-019 dramatically simplifies GraphRAG:

- No Neo4j, no Microsoft GraphRAG dependencies
- Reuses existing Qdrant collections
- Native LlamaIndex integration
- Can be added/removed without affecting core system

### 3. Test Qwen3 + Instructor Early

Validate structured output generation with local model early in Week 1.

### 4. Keep Optional Modules Optional

DSPy (ADR-018) and GraphRAG (ADR-019) should remain feature-flagged.

## Final Verdict

> **✅ READY TO START IMPLEMENTATION**

The architecture is sound, coherent, and implementable within the 3-week timeline. The simplification of GraphRAG to use PropertyGraphIndex removes the last major complexity concern. All libraries are compatible, the local-first approach is validated, and the implementation path is clear.

### Next Steps

1. Delete ADR-005 and ADR-008 (or move to future considerations)
2. Set up development environment with validated dependencies
3. Begin Week 1 implementation with document processing pipeline
4. Test Qwen3 + Instructor integration early
