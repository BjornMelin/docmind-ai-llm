# ADR-011-NEW: Agent Orchestration Framework

## Title

LangGraph-Based Agent Orchestration with Local-First Agentic Patterns

## Version/Date

4.2 / 2025-08-18

## Status

Accepted

## Description

Implements a simplified agent orchestration framework using the pre-built `langgraph-supervisor` library to coordinate the agentic RAG system. This approach replaces complex custom orchestration code with a proven supervisor pattern, dramatically reducing implementation complexity while maintaining all required functionality for local-first operation.

## Context

The modernized architecture introduces multiple agentic components that need coordination:

1. **Query Routing Agent**: Determines optimal retrieval strategy
2. **Planning Agent**: Decomposes complex queries into sub-tasks
3. **Retrieval Agent**: Executes multi-stage retrieval optimized for 32K context windows
4. **Synthesis Agent**: Combines results from multiple retrieval passes
5. **Response Validation Agent**: Ensures response quality and accuracy

These agents need orchestration to work together effectively while maintaining context efficiency and local-first constraints. The `langgraph-supervisor` library provides the optimal solution with proven supervisor patterns, automatic state management, and conditional execution - eliminating the need for custom orchestration code while optimizing for 32K native context windows.

## Related Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-1:** Orchestrate multi-agent workflows with conditional execution
- **FR-2:** Maintain conversation context across agent interactions
- **FR-3:** Provide fallback mechanisms when agent decisions fail
- **FR-4:** Support both synchronous and asynchronous agent execution
- **FR-5:** Enable agent introspection and decision transparency

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1:** **(Performance)** Agent coordination overhead <500ms per query
- **NFR-2:** **(Reliability)** Graceful degradation when individual agents fail
- **NFR-3:** **(Local-First)** All agent operations execute locally without external APIs
- **NFR-4:** **(Maintainability)** Clear agent boundaries and testable workflows

## Alternatives

### 1. Single Monolithic Agent

- **Description**: Single agent handling all RAG operations
- **Issues**: Limited flexibility, no specialization, difficult error recovery
- **Score**: 4/10 (simplicity: 8, capability: 2, maintainability: 2)

### 2. Manual Agent Coordination

- **Description**: Custom orchestration logic without framework
- **Issues**: Complex state management, error-prone coordination, hard to debug
- **Score**: 5/10 (control: 8, reliability: 3, maintainability: 4)

### 3. Heavy Multi-Agent Framework (AutoGen)

- **Description**: Full enterprise multi-agent system
- **Issues**: Over-engineered for single-user app, complex setup, resource intensive
- **Score**: 6/10 (capability: 9, complexity: 3, resource-usage: 4)

### 4. LangGraph Supervisor Library (Selected)

- **Description**: Pre-built supervisor pattern using `langgraph-supervisor-py`
- **Benefits**: Proven library (1.2k stars), ~90% code reduction, battle-tested patterns
- **Score**: 10/10 (capability: 9, simplicity: 10, reliability: 10)

## Decision

We will implement **LangGraph Supervisor-Based Orchestration** using the `langgraph-supervisor` library with:

### Core Components (5 Agents Total)

1. **Supervisor Agent**: Central coordinator using `create_supervisor()` function
2. **Query Routing Agent**: Analyzes queries and determines retrieval strategy
3. **Planning Agent**: Decomposes complex queries into manageable sub-tasks
4. **Retrieval Agent**: Executes optimized retrieval with DSPy query rewriting
5. **Synthesis Agent**: Combines and reconciles results from multiple sources
6. **Response Validation Agent**: Ensures accuracy and quality of final response

### Additional Components

- **Handoff Tools**: Automatic agent-to-agent delegation via supervisor library
- **Context Preservation**: Built-in conversation and decision context management
- **Error Handling**: Library-provided error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- **Observability Integration**: Standard supervisor metrics and logging hooks
