#### Agent Coordination Examples

**Simple Query Flow:**

```text
Query: "What is the project budget?"

Router ‚Üí Retrieval ‚Üí Validator ‚Üí Response
Time: ~1 second
```

**Complex Query Flow:**

```text
Query: "Compare Q1 vs Q2 performance, identify trends, and recommend actions"

Router ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí [Retrieve Q1, Retrieve Q2, Analyze Trends] ‚Üí Synthesizer ‚Üí Validator ‚Üí Response  
Time: ~3 seconds
```

### Query Types and Best Practices

#### Effective Query Formulation

**‚úÖ Specific Information Requests**:

*Good Examples:*

```text
What are the key findings from the 2023 financial audit?
List the project milestones mentioned in the requirements document.
Who are the stakeholders identified in the project charter?
```

*Why These Work:*

- Clear, specific scope
- Identifiable information type
- Context-appropriate language

**‚úÖ Comparative Analysis Queries**:

*Good Examples:*

```text
Compare the marketing strategies proposed in documents A and B.
How do the Q1 sales figures differ from Q2 results?
What are the pros and cons of each implementation approach?
```

*Why These Work:*

- Clear comparison subjects
- Specific comparison criteria
- Expected analytical output

**‚úÖ Multi-Step Analytical Questions**:

*Good Examples:*

```text
What risks are identified in the project plan, how severe are they, and what mitigation strategies are proposed?
Analyze the customer feedback themes, prioritize by frequency, and suggest improvements.
```

*Why These Work:*

- Logical step progression
- Clear analytical framework
- Actionable output expected

#### Query Optimization Tips

**üéØ Be Specific About Context**:

```text
‚ùå "What do the documents say about revenue?"
‚úÖ "What was the total revenue for Q3 2023 according to the financial report?"
```

**üéØ Use Document-Specific Language**:

```text
‚ùå "Tell me about the thing in section 2"
‚úÖ "Explain the risk assessment methodology described in section 2 of the security audit"
```

**üéØ Frame Complex Questions Clearly**:

```text
‚ùå "Compare everything and tell me what's best"
‚úÖ "Compare the three proposed architectures based on cost, performance, and maintainability, then recommend the optimal choice"
```

### Response Interpretation

#### Understanding Response Components

**Main Response Structure:**

- **Primary Answer**: Direct response to your question
- **Supporting Evidence**: Quotes and references from source documents
- **Source Attribution**: Specific document and section references
- **Confidence Metadata**: Quality scores and processing information

**Quality Indicators:**

**Validation Score (0.0 - 1.0):**

- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent - High confidence, well-supported answer
- **0.8-0.9**: Good - Solid answer with minor limitations
- **0.7-0.8**: Acceptable - Adequate answer, some uncertainty
- **<0.7**: Review needed - May lack sufficient evidence

**Source Count and Distribution:**

- **Multiple Sources**: More comprehensive analysis
- **Diverse Sections**: Broader coverage of topic
- **Recent References**: Up-to-date information prioritized

**Processing Time Indicators:**

- **<1s**: Simple retrieval, direct answers
- **1-3s**: Standard multi-agent coordination
- **3-5s**: Complex analysis or large document processing
- **>5s**: May indicate system load or very complex queries

#### Agent Contribution Analysis

Monitor which agents contributed to understand query complexity:

**Agent Usage Patterns:**

```text
Simple Query: Router + Retrieval + Validator
Complex Query: Router + Planner + Multiple Retrieval + Synthesizer + Validator
Comparative Query: Router + Planner + Parallel Retrieval + Synthesizer + Validator
```

**Performance Optimization:**

- Queries consistently using all agents may benefit from simplification
- Fast router-only responses indicate well-matched simple queries
- Frequent fallback modes suggest configuration optimization needed

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Multi-Document Analysis

#### Cross-Document Queries

**Relationship Analysis:**

```text
How do the requirements in document A relate to the implementation in document B?
Which solutions mentioned in the technical spec address the problems identified in the analysis report?
```

**Consistency Checking:**

```text
Are there any contradictions between the financial projections and the business plan?
Do the test results align with the expected outcomes in the design document?
```

**Gap Analysis:**

```text
What requirements from the specification are not addressed in the implementation guide?
Which risks identified in the audit are not covered by the mitigation plan?
```

#### Sequential Document Processing

**Time-Series Analysis:**

```text
How have the project milestones evolved from the initial plan to the latest update?
Track the changes in budget allocations across the quarterly reports.
```

**Version Comparison:**

```text
What are the key differences between version 1.0 and 2.0 of the product specification?
Compare the original proposal with the final approved version.
```

### Conversation Context Management

#### Building on Previous Queries

**Contextual Follow-ups:**

```text
Initial: "What are the main project risks?"
Follow-up: "Which of these risks have the highest impact?"
Follow-up: "What mitigation strategies are proposed for the high-impact risks?"
```

**Reference Previous Results:**

```text
Based on the budget analysis you just provided, which departments are over their allocation?
Using the performance metrics from my last query, what trends do you see over time?
```

#### Context Optimization

**Managing Context Windows:**

- DocMind AI automatically manages 128K token context
