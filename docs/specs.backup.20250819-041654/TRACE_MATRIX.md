## Critical Path Analysis

### Blocking Requirements

These requirements must be implemented first as others depend on them:

1. **REQ-0061** (100% offline) - Blocks all functionality
2. **REQ-0063** (LLM model) - Blocks agent system
3. **REQ-0047** (Qdrant) - Blocks retrieval
4. **REQ-0071** (Streamlit) - Blocks all UI features
5. **REQ-0081** (Config) - Blocks settings management

### High-Risk Requirements

Requirements with significant technical complexity or performance implications:

1. **REQ-0001** - Multi-agent coordination complexity
2. **REQ-0007** - Agent latency constraint
3. **REQ-0026** - Document processing throughput
4. **REQ-0046** - Query latency constraint
5. **REQ-0064** - Token generation speed
