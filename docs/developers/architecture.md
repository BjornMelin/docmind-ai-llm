# DocMind AI Architecture Overview

## High-Level Components

- **Frontend:** Streamlit UI for uploads, configs, results, chat.

- **Backend:** Ollama/LlamaCpp/LM Studio for LLM inference.

- **Orchestration:** LangChain for chains, retrievers, embeddings.

- **Storage:** Qdrant for hybrid vector search.

- **Processing:** Utils for loading, chunking, analysis.

## Data Flow

1. User uploads docs → Loaded/split in utils.py.
2. Indexed in Qdrant with hybrid embeddings (Jina v4 dense, FastEmbed sparse).
3. Analysis: LLMChain processes with prompts → Structured via Pydantic.
4. Chat: RetrievalQA with reranking (Jina v2 + submodular opt).
5. GPU: torch.cuda for embeddings/reranking if enabled.

## Key Technologies

- Embeddings: HuggingFace (Jina v4), FastEmbed (SPLADE++).

- Optimization: PEFT for efficiency, late chunking with NLTK.

- Error Handling: Tenacity for retry logic with exponential backoff.

- Logging: Loguru for structured logging with automatic rotation.

- Caching: Diskcache for document processing (90% performance improvement).

## Architecture Design

DocMind AI follows modern library-first principles for reliability and maintainability:

- **Robust Error Handling**: Tenacity-based retry logic with exponential backoff

- **Structured Logging**: Loguru integration for comprehensive monitoring and debugging

- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Pydantic BaseSettings for validated configuration management

- **High-Performance Caching**: Document processing cache layer delivers 90% speed improvement

- **Production-Ready Components**: Enterprise-grade reliability with comprehensive error recovery
