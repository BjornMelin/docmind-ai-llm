## Architecture Approaches

### Decision Framework Analysis

Based on multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted factors:

| Criterion | Weight | Minimal Score | Standard Score | Comprehensive Score |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Maintenance Burden | 0.25 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.3 |
| Feedback Speed | 0.30 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.4 |
| Quality Assurance | 0.25 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.9 |
| Implementation Complexity | 0.20 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.3 |

**When to Use Each Approach:**

- **Minimal (0.825)**: Early development, small teams, rapid iteration
- **Comprehensive**: Production systems, larger teams, strict quality requirements

### Core Principle

**Keep workflows minimal, move logic to external scripts**

Both approaches focus on orchestration rather than complex YAML logic, based on research findings from CI/CD experts.

## Comprehensive Pipeline

### Architecture

The comprehensive pipeline provides intelligent test selection and quality gate enforcement with multiple validation stages.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Quality Gates Failing

**Symptom**: Tests pass but quality gates fail

```bash
❌ Success rate 45.5% below target threshold
```

**Solution**:

```bash
# Analyze failing tests
python scripts/performance_monitor_ci.py --analyze-latest

# Check specific gate
python scripts/quality_gates_ci.py --success-rate
```

#### 2. Performance Regression

**Symptom**: Tests taking longer than expected

```bash
❌ Average test time 0.25s exceeds 0.2s threshold
```

**Solution**:

```bash
# Performance analysis
python scripts/performance_monitor_ci.py --regression-check

# Identify slow tests
pytest --durations=20 tests/unit/
```

#### 3. Tests Failing in CI but Passing Locally

```bash
# Check for missing test dependencies
uv sync --extra test

# Verify Python version compatibility
uv run python --version

# Run tests with same parameters as CI
uv run python scripts/run_tests.py --unit --integration
```

#### 4. Coverage Regression

**Symptom**: Coverage below threshold

```bash
❌ Coverage 28.5% below 29% threshold
```

**Solution**:

```bash
# Coverage analysis
python scripts/performance_monitor_ci.py --dashboard

# Generate detailed report
coverage html

# Compare against baseline (29.71%)
# If legitimate decrease, update MIN_COVERAGE in workflow
```

#### 5. Workflow Timeout

```bash
# Profile slow tests locally
uv run pytest --durations=10

# Consider splitting long tests or increasing timeout
# Default: 10 minutes per job
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Comprehensive debugging
python scripts/run_tests_ci_optimized.py --quality-gates --coverage-report

# Performance debugging
python scripts/performance_monitor_ci.py --dashboard

# Quality gate debugging
python scripts/quality_gates_ci.py --generate-report
```

## Adaptation Framework

### Adding New Quality Gates

**Priority Order** (add only when current gates are stable):

1. **Code Quality** (when coverage >40%):

   ```yaml
   - name: Run linting
     run: uv run ruff check .
   ```

2. **Type Checking** (when codebase matures):

   ```yaml
   - name: Type checking
     run: uv run mypy src/
   ```

3. **Security Scans** (for production systems):

   ```yaml
   - name: Security scan
     uses: github/super-linter@v4
   ```

### Updating Quality Gate Thresholds

1. Monitor trends over 2-3 weeks
2. Update thresholds in `env` section
3. Document rationale in git commit message
4. Avoid frequent changes (stability > perfection)

### Performance Optimization

**When CI time >5 minutes:**

1. **Add Parallel Testing**:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests in parallel
     run: uv run pytest -n auto
   ```

2. **Enable Test Sharding** (for large test suites):

   ```yaml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

3. **Cache Dependencies**:

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/cache@v4
     with:
       path: ~/.cache/uv
       key: uv-${{ hashFiles('uv.lock') }}
   ```

## Future Evolution

### When to Add Complexity

**Add Standard Quality Gates when**:

- Coverage consistently >40%
- Team size >3 developers
- Codebase >10K lines
- Merge frequency >5 PRs/week

**Add Comprehensive Gates when**:

- Production system with users
- Security requirements mandate it
- Performance regression impacts users
- Compliance requirements exist

### Migration Path

This implementation provides a foundation for systematic evolution:

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Test execution + coverage
2. **Phase 2** (When stable): Add linting + type checking
