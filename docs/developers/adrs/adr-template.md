## Decision

<!-- 
State the decision clearly and unambiguously. This should be a direct statement of the chosen path.
-->
We will adopt **[Chosen Solution]** to address [the problem]. This involves using **[Specific Library/Pattern/Component]** configured with **[Key Parameters]**. This decision supersedes **[any previous ADRs or decisions, if applicable]**.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1:** **(Maintainability)** [The solution must reduce code complexity by at least X%.]
- **NFR-2:** **(Security)** [The solution must not introduce new vulnerabilities and must operate offline.]
- **NFR-3:** **(Scalability)** [The component must handle X concurrent requests.]

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-1:** [Query latency must be below X milliseconds under Y load.]
- **PR-2:** [Resource utilization (CPU/VRAM) must not exceed X% on target hardware.]

### Integration Requirements

- **IR-1:** [The solution must integrate natively with the LlamaIndex `Settings` singleton.]
- **IR-2:** [The component must be callable via asynchronous patterns (`async/await`).]

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-[XXX]** ([Title of related ADR]): [Briefly explain the relationship, e.g., "This decision builds upon the core architecture defined in ADR-XXX."]
- **ADR-[YYY]** ([Title of related ADR]): [e.g., "The component chosen here will be configured via the `Settings` singleton established in ADR-YYY."]

## Design

<!-- 
This is the "how" section. Provide enough detail for another engineer to understand and implement the decision.
-->

### Architecture Overview

<!-- Use a Mermaid diagram to visualize the new architecture, data flow, or component interaction. -->

### Implementation Details

<!-- 
Provide code snippets to illustrate the implementation. Show "before" and "after" if it helps clarify the change. Be specific about file paths and function names. Keep concise here with enough detail to implement the code in full correctly per the ADR. Full file should aim for ~600 lines max so keep that in mind.
-->
**In `src/utils/component_setup.py`:**

```python
# Brief comment explaining the code snippet
from some_library import ChosenComponent
from project.core import Settings

def setup_new_component():
    """This function initializes and configures the chosen component."""
    component = ChosenComponent(
        parameter=Settings.some_value,
        another_parameter=True
    )
    return component
```

### Configuration

<!-- Detail any new configuration settings, environment variables, or settings managed in a central place. -->
**In `.env` or `settings.py`:**

```env
# New environment variable for the component
COMPONENT_API_KEY="your-key-here"
COMPONENT_TIMEOUT=60
```

## Testing

<!-- 
Describe the strategy for testing this new architecture. Include code snippets for tests where appropriate. Keep as skeleton code to give enough detail/comments to implement the tests but do not write the full test suites here. Make sure to mention the `pytest` framework, mock dependencies, and the async/await patterns.  Full file should aim for ~600 lines max so keep that in mind.
-->
**In `tests/test_component.py`:**

```python
import pytest
from project.component import new_functionality

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_component_performance():
    """Verify that the new component meets performance requirements."""
    # Test setup
    start_time = time.monotonic()
    result = await new_functionality("test input")
    duration = time.monotonic() - start_time
    
    # Assertions
    assert result is not None
    assert duration < 0.05 # 50ms latency target

def test_configuration_toggle():
    """Verify that a feature can be toggled via settings."""
    # Test logic
    pass
```

## Consequences

<!-- 
Analyze the results and impact of the decision.
-->

### Positive Outcomes

- [e.g., "Enables real-time data processing across 3 core modules, reducing end-to-end pipeline latency from 2.5s to 400ms."]
- [e.g., "Unlocks concurrent user sessions up to 500 (previously 50), directly supporting the product roadmap for multi-tenant deployment."]
- [e.g., "Standardizes authentication flow across API, web UI, and CLI components, eliminating 4 separate auth implementations."]
- [e.g., "Reduces onboarding complexity: New features now require 2 files instead of 8, with consistent patterns across all modules."]
- [e.g., "Eliminates manual configuration steps in deployment, reducing production setup time from 45 minutes to 5 minutes."]

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- [e.g., "Introduces dependency on `langchain-core>=0.3.0`, requiring quarterly security audits and potential migration effort."]
- [e.g., "Memory usage increases by ~200MB per worker due to model caching, requiring infrastructure scaling."]
- [e.g., "Deprecates existing sync API endpoints, requiring client migration within 6 months."]
- [e.g., "Conflicts with ADR-003's connection pooling, requiring rework or accepting reduced efficiency."]
- [e.g., "Creates inconsistency with legacy sync modules, requiring future refactoring effort."]

### Ongoing Maintenance & Considerations

- [e.g., "API rate limits and timeout values require quarterly review based on usage patterns"]
- [e.g., "Monitor `fastapi` releases for breaking changes and test compatibility"]
- [e.g., "Track response latency metrics and revisit caching if P95 exceeds 200ms"]  
- [e.g., "Authentication tokens expire every 90 days - coordinate renewals with DevOps"]
- [e.g., "Update API docs when schemas change, maintain backward compatibility"]
- [e.g., "Ensure 2+ team members understand async/await patterns via knowledge transfer"]

### Dependencies

- **System**: [e.g., `tesseract-ocr` if adding OCR capabilities.]
- **Python**: [e.g., `llama-index-core>=0.12.0`, `tenacity>=8.2.0`.]
- **Removed**: [e.g., `diskcache` (replaced by native solution).]
