# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone. We prioritize a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors and users, regardless of background or experience level.

## Standards

To ensure a positive environment, we expect all participants to:

* **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and treat others with empathy.
* **Be Constructive**: Feedback should be helpful and focused on the code and ideas, not the person.
* **Be Professional**: Acts of harassment, insults, or other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

* Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Contributors who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.
