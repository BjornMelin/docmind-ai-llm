"""Validation Testing for DocMind AI Configuration and Integrity.

This package contains comprehensive validation tests to ensure
the reliability, correctness, and robustness of system configurations,
input processing, and data integrity.

Test Categories:
- Configuration Validation
- Input Sanitization
- Model Parameter Validation
- Data Integrity Checks
- Type Checking and Enforcement

Validation Principles:
- Enforce strict input type and value constraints
- Validate configuration parameters against research standards
- Prevent invalid state transitions
- Provide meaningful error messages

Scope:
- Verify startup configurations
- Check model and hardware compatibility
- Validate RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) parameters
- Ensure security and compliance

Note:
    These tests are crucial for maintaining system reliability
    and preventing runtime errors through rigorous input validation.
