# DocMind AI - Completed Tasks

**Source**: Based on full conversation review, final decisions, architecture (e.g., LlamaIndex pipelines/retrievers, LangGraph supervisor with planning/Send, Unstructured parsing, SQLite/diskcache caching), and current codebase state.

**Note**: This file contains all tasks and subtasks that have been completed as of 02:02 AM MDT on Saturday, July 26, 2025. The remaining tasks are in TODO.md.

## Group 1: Core Retrieval Foundation

- **Task 0: Upgrade to BGE-Large Dense Embeddings** (Completed)
  - [x] Replaced Jina v4 with BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 (1024D)
  - [x] Updated vector dimensions in Qdrant setup

- **Task 1: Complete SPLADE++ Sparse Embeddings**
  - [x] Subtask 1.0: Implement sparse embeddings support (Completed)
  - [x] Subtask 1.0.1: Fix Qdrant hybrid search configuration (Completed)

- **Task 1.5: Add RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** (Completed)
  - [x] Simple RRF implementation for combining dense/sparse results
  - [x] Use research-backed weights (dense: 0.7, sparse: 0.3)
  - [x] Implement prefetch mechanism for performance
  - [x] Native Qdrant RRF fusion with optimized prefetch
  - [x] Configuration in models.py (0.7/0.3)
  - [x] Seamless LlamaIndex hybrid_alpha calculation

- **Task 4: Integrate ColBERT Late Interaction Model** (Completed)
  - [x] Deploy colbert-ir/colbertv2.0 via FastEmbed
  - [x] Implement as postprocessor in query pipeline
  - [x] Configure optimal top-k reranking (retrieve 20, rerank to 5)
  - [x] Add performance monitoring and optimization

---

## Success Criteria (Completed)

- [x] Application starts without errors
- [x] Users can upload and analyze documents (including PDFs with images)
- [x] Hybrid search returns relevant results with reranking
- [x] GPU acceleration works when available, fails gracefully when not
